GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to host and manage Git repositories. 
It was created in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular code-hosting platforms on the internet, with millions of users and millions of repositories.
GitHub allows developers to easily create, collaborate on, and share code with others. 
Developers can use GitHub to store their code and track changes made to it over time, collaborate with others on the same codebase, and manage issues and bugs.

In conclusion, Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes to code over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting and collaboration tools for Git repositories, making it easier for developers to work together on the same codebase. 
In short, Git is a tool and GitHub is a service that uses Git.
Developers can use Git without using GitHub, but they cannot use GitHub without using Git.
